# linearRegression
These 3 programs are a greate way to implement Univariate Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Multivariate Regression & Classification from scratch.
While its not recommended that you use these for any projects, it will be a good start to implemnt and practically see all the math that goes behind designing any of these 
regressors. 


Prob1.dat is used for prob1_fit.py which is a Univariate Regressor. 
Prob2.dat is used fot prob2_fit.py which is a Polynomial Regressor.
Prob3.dat is used for prob3_fit.py which is a Multivariate Regressor.

Just run these with their respective data file, all regressors have visualization in them to see how the regressor was able to fit the data.
